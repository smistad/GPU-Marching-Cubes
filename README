Dependencies
----------------------------
OpenGL, GLUT, GLU, GLEW and OpenCL (with C++ bindings)

Notes about implementation
----------------------------
* Example 3D RAW files can be downloaded from www.volvis.org
* Currently only supports 8 bit raw files, but should be easily extended to other types
* See LICENCE file for license information

Compiling
---------------------------
When compiling remember to link all libraries and include OpenCL include dir. Example:
g++ -c -Wall -I /path/to/OpenCL/include  gpu-mc.cpp rawUtilities.cpp main.cpp openCLGLUtilities.cpp
g++ -L /path/to/OpenCL/lib/x86_64 -l OpenCL -lGLEW -lGLU -lglut gpu-mc.o openCLUtilities.o openCLGLUtilities.o rawUtilities.o main.o -o host


Usage
----------------------------
Run the program with the following arguments:

filename.raw sizeX sizeY sizeZ [stepSizeX stepSizeY stepSizeZ]
